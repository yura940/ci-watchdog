# 🐶 CI-Watchdog   
![Security Status](./assets/badge.svg)

**CI-Watchdog** is an automated DevSecOps agent designed to monitor and enhance the security of GitHub repositories through CI/CD pipelines, with a primary focus on **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Detect vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and secrets  
- Run automatic scans on every push or pull request  
- Generate a centralized, structured HTML security report  
- Display results directly in GitHub Actions logs (no need for GitHub Pages)  
- Easy to integrate into any existing GitHub repository  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- [🕵️‍♂️ Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) — secrets detection  
- [🔍 Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) — vulnerability & dependency scanning  
- [📜 Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) — static code analysis (SAST)  
- [🏗️ Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) — Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning *(coming soon)*

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
.github/workflows/ci.yml       # CI workflow definition  
generate_report.py             # HTML report generator  
scans/                         # Scan output folders (JSON)  
report/                        # Generated report.html  
assets/                        # Badge and visuals  
```

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. **Copy the workflow**  
   Copy `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into your repo.

2. **Add the Python script**  
   Place `generate_report.py` at the root of your repo.

3. **Create scan folders**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p scans/gitleaks scans/trivy scans/semgrep
   touch scans/gitleaks/.gitkeep scans/trivy/.gitkeep scans/semgrep/.gitkeep
   ```

4. **Commit & Push**  
   ```bash
   git add .github generate_report.py scans
   git commit -m "add: CI-Watchdog security pipeline"
   git push
   ```

5. **Check GitHub Actions logs**  
   After push/PR, the pipeline runs and the **HTML security report is printed in the logs**.

## ✅ Tested On

CI-Watchdog was successfully tested on [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop), detecting:

- ✅ Leaked secrets (API keys, passwords, JWTs…)  
- ✅ Vulnerable dependencies (Trivy)  
- ✅ Insecure code patterns (Semgrep)  
- ➕ Future: IaC misconfigurations (Checkov)

## 📈 Security Badge

A dynamic badge (SVG) will reflect the latest scan status.
